Failure to do so may result in us being unable to contact you regarding your Account or to let you know about changes to these Terms and Conditions.</p>
                <p><strong>8.9 </strong>If you request to recall a Transaction due to an error or mistake caused other than by Modulr, we reserve the right to charge you (i) a handling fee of &pound;25 per recall and (ii) any fee payable by Modulr to a third-party bank or institution for handling the recall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><strong>8.10</strong> You agree to indemnify and hold harmless, us, Modulr and our distributors, partners, agents, sponsors, and service providers and their group companies from and against the costs of any legal action taken to enforce this Agreement, including these Terms and Conditions and/or any breach of these Terms and Conditions by you.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>9. DISPUTES AND INCORRECT TRANSACTIONS</strong></p>
                <p><strong>9.1</strong> If you (or an Account Manager or Cardholder) have a reason to believe that (i) a Transaction on your Account was unauthorised or was made incorrectly, (ii) a Physical Card is lost or stolen; or (iii) someone else (other than TPP) knows the security credentials or otherwise has &lrm;unauthorised access to your Account and/or Card,&lrm; you must inform us immediately by contacting Customer Services. After you notify us, we will replace a lost, stolen or misappropriated Physical Card and/or security credentials, as appropriate.&lrm;</p>
                <p>&lrm;<strong>9.2</strong> We will investigate your claim for a refund of unauthorised or incorrectly executed Transactions, provided at all times that you &lrm;have notified us without undue delay of becoming aware of such incorrectly executed or &lrm;unauthorised Transaction and in any case<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>&lrm;within the timeframes required by the Card Scheme rules if the incorrect Transaction relates to a Card &lrm;Transaction and for &lrm;all other Transactions within 13 months of the date of the relevant Transaction&lrm;. We will not be liable for any unauthorised or incorrectly executed Transactions notified to us after this &lrm;period.&lrm;</p>
                <p><strong>9.3</strong> If you dispute a Transaction:<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><strong>9.3.1</strong> subject to 9.3.2 and 9.3.3 we will immediately refund the amount to your Account to the position it would have been in if the unauthorised Transaction had not taken place. We will have no further liability to you. If we subsequently discover that you were not entitled to a refund, we shall treat the refund as a mistake and be entitled to reapply the Transaction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><strong>9.3.2</strong> if there are reasonable grounds for thinking that you may not be entitled to a refund (based on the evidence available to us at the time you report the unauthorised Transaction), we may investigate before giving you a refund and we will provide you with our supporting evidence if we believe you are not entitled to the refund;</p>
                <p><strong>9.3.3</strong> if the Transaction was initiated through a TPP, it is for the TPP to prove that, the Transaction was authenticated, accurately recorded and not affected by a technical breakdown or other deficiency linked to the TPP&rsquo;s payment initiation service; and</p>
                <p>&lrm;<strong>9.3.4&lrm;</strong> if we make an error on a Transaction made to someone else through the Direct Debit &lrm;scheme, we will refund you in &lrm;accordance with the Direct Debit Guarantee&lrm;.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><strong>9.4. </strong>If an incorrect Transaction is paid into your Account that should not have, we will, where possible, immediately send the funds back to the bank acting for the person from whose account the Transaction was made. In such circumstance you agree to return the funds to us and provide such assistance that we require in recovering the amount from you. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>If we cannot recover the funds, we are required to provide sufficient details about you and the incorrect payment to the bank or institution that sent the payment to enable them to recover the funds.</p>
                <p><strong>9.5</strong> You will be liable for all Transactions made from your Account if you (or the Account Manager or the Cardholder) have acted fraudulently or have failed with gross negligence:</p>
                <p><strong>9.5.1&lrm;</strong> to keep the security credentials used to access or use your Account and/or Card safe and secure or otherwise failed to &lrm;comply with these &lrm;Terms and Conditions in relation to the safety of your Account and/or Card; or&lrm;</p>
                <p>&lrm;<strong>9.5.2</strong>&lrm; failed to notify us in accordance with 9.1 above&lrm;.</p>
                <p><strong>9.6</strong> You may be entitled to a refund where a Transaction from your account which was initiated by payee provided that:</p>
                <p><strong>9.6.1</strong> the authorisation did not specify the exact amount;</p>
                <p><strong>9.6.2</strong> the amount of Transaction exceeded the amount you could reasonably have expected (taking into your previous spending pattern and other relevant circumstances). We may ask you to provide such information as is reasonably necessary for us to determine if this is correct; and</p>
                <p><strong>9.6.3</strong> you asked for a refund within 8 weeks of the date the Transaction was debited to your Account.</p>
                <p>In such circumstances we will refund you within 10 Business Days of receiving your claim for a refund or, where applicable, within 10 Business Days of receiving any further information we requested - or we will provide you with reasons for refusing the refund.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><strong>9.7</strong> If you want a refund for a Transaction made using the Direct Debit scheme, the Direct Debit Guarantee will apply instead of the terms in 9.6 above.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>10. VARIATION</strong></p>
                <p><strong>10.1</strong> We may change these Terms and Conditions by providing you with at least two months&rsquo; prior notice by e-mail (provided you have supplied us with an up-to-date e-mail address).</p>
                <p><strong>10.2</strong> If you do not agree with the changes to the Terms and Conditions, you may at any time within the two months&rsquo; notice period notify us and these Terms and Conditions will be terminated and your Account closed. If you do not notify us to the contrary during this period then you will be deemed to have accepted the change and it will apply to you when it comes into force.</p>
                <p><strong>10.3</strong> If any part of these Terms and Conditions are inconsistent with any legal requirements then we will not rely on that part but treat it as if it did actually reflect the relevant legal requirement. If we need to make operational changes before we can fully comply with the new regulatory requirement, we will make those changes as soon as reasonably practical.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>11. TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION</strong></p>
                <p><strong>11.1</strong> We can terminate your Account at any time if we give you two months&rsquo; notice and transfer any Available Balance at the time to your nominated bank account without a charge.</p>
                <p><strong>11.2</strong> We can suspend or terminate your Account at any time with immediate effect (and until your default has been remedied or the Agreement terminated) without any prior notice to you if:</p>
                <p><strong>11.2.1</strong> we discover any of the Information that we hold for you is false, misleading or materially incorrect; or</p>
                <p><strong>11.2.2</strong> if you, the Account Manager, the Cardholder or a third party has engaged in fraudulent activity, money laundering, terrorism, terrorism financing or other illegal activity in connection with your Account or we have reasonable suspicions in respect of the same; or</p>
                <p><strong>11.2.3</strong> if you have reached your Account Limit;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><strong>11.2.4</strong> you or the Account Manager have breached these Terms and Conditions; or<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><strong>11.2.5</strong> we are required to do so under any applicable law or regulation or at the direction of any regulatory, law enforcement or other competent authority.</p>
                <p><strong>11.3</strong> In the event that we do suspend or terminate your Account then if we are able to do so, we will tell you in advance otherwise we will let you know immediately afterwards (to the extent we are permitted by law).<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>12. OUR LIABILITY</strong></p>
